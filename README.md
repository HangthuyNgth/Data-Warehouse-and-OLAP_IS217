# Traffic Accident Data Analysis Project (2022-2023)

## Introduction

This project focuses on analyzing traffic accident data in the United States from 2022 to 2023. The goal is to build a **Data Warehouse** and perform **OLAP analysis** to extract meaningful insights. Key processes include ETL using SSIS, creating cubes in SSAS, writing MDX queries, generating reports with Excel and Power BI, and performing data mining techniques.

## Objective

The objective of this project is to analyze the U.S. traffic accident dataset comprehensively, ensuring effective data warehousing, cube-based analysis, reporting, and data mining. This helps uncover patterns and trends related to traffic incidents to inform potential safety improvements.

## Project Structure

1. **Software Requirement Specification (SRS)**  
   The SRS document describes the functional and non-functional requirements for JMS, including system requirements, main features, performance, and security requirements. It serves as a key reference for project members during development and testing.

2. **Installation Guide**  
   - **Installation Guide**: Detailed instructions for deploying and installing JMS on a computer for testing and usage.

3. **Test Plan**  
   - **Test Plan**: A comprehensive testing plan with strategies and testing scope, ensuring all main features of the system are thoroughly tested.
     
4. **Test Cases**  
   - **Test Cases**: Utilize both Black-box and White-box testing techniques to ensure comprehensive coverage.
   - **Unit Test Cases**: Design and execute tests for individual modules or functions.
   - **Unit Testing**: Perform unit testing on core functionalities using tools like NUnit.
   - **Automated Testing**: Implement automated tests using tools TestComplete to streamline the testing process.

5. **Defect and Bug List**  
   A compilation of bugs found during testing, including bugs identified through static testing, document review, and code review.

6. **Team Evaluation**  
   Team member performance evaluations, using self-evaluation and peer-evaluation files

## Key Features of the Project
- **ETL Process** using SSIS for data extraction, transformation, and loading.  
- **Cube Design** in SSAS for multidimensional analysis.  
- **MDX Queries** for interacting with and analyzing the cube.  
- **Reports** generated with Excel Pivot Tables and Power BI.  
- **Data Mining** for discovering hidden patterns and insights.

## Dataset Information

- **Source:** [US Accidents Dataset on Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/sobhanmoosavi/us-accidents)  
- **Years Covered:** 2022-2023  

## Expected Outcome

By the end of this project, we aim to deliver:

- A fully functional **Data Warehouse** with the U.S. traffic accident dataset.  
- Comprehensive **OLAP analysis** using SSAS and MDX queries.  
- Detailed **Reports** with insights into traffic accident trends.  
- Results from **Data Mining** techniques applied to the dataset.  
- A thorough **Final Report** documenting all processes and outcomes.

## Tools Used

- **SSIS** (SQL Server Integration Services) for ETL.  
- **SSAS** (SQL Server Analysis Services) for cube creation.  
- **Power BI** and **Excel** for reporting.  
- **MDX** for cube queries.  
- **Visual Studio Code** and **Google Colab** for analysis and pattern discovery.  
- **Notion/Trello** for task and project management.
